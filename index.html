      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>My name is Afnaf Hussain. I was born in Bangladesh in 1997 but moved to
        New Zealand in 1998, and finally, to Australia in 2006. Growing up in
      Australia, I had amalgamated both Bangladeshi and Australian culture</p>

   <h2>Interest in Information Technology</h2>
   <p>I've been an avid video gamer for years, Assassin's Creed 2 being one of
     my favourites. Through my immersion within these worlds, I have come to
     question how it is possible to create such vast and interactable worlds
     whilst sitting behind a computer. Hence, my interest in information
     technology. I'm currently studying Bachelor of Information
     Technology at RMIT University Australia. As I progress deeper into my
    studies, I expect to learn many different coding languages and how and when
      to implement them into my future projects. </p>

     <p>
The game development software engineer at KONAMI Australia is responsible for
developing state of the art software that is used by a team in the development
of a remarkable game. Within this role, you are expected to work within a team
of other engineers, designers, artists and writers to develop a brand new game
whilst fixing technical issues on already existing products developed by the
company.
<br>
This role is appealing to me due to being a part of a team that will be
creating games that include a story, paired with addictive and revolutionary
gameplay that grasps the player and makes them feel apart of the world.
<br>
Currently, I am a novice when it comes to sodtware development, however, within my
journey in becoming a seasoned programmer, I will develop my skills in various
languages (C++, Python, etc) and design. With these newly acquired set of skills,
I will implement them in my future projects.
